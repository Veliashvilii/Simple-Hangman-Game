# Simple Hangman Game

A simple iOS hangman game built with Swift.

## Overview

This project is a basic implementation of the classic hangman game for iOS devices. Users can guess letters to reveal a hidden word, and they win if they guess all the letters correctly within a certain number of tries. The game fetches a random word from an online API and displays it as a series of blank spaces, which are gradually filled in as the user makes correct guesses.

## Features

- Fetches random words from an online API.
- Allows users to input letters and submit guesses.
- Provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Keeps track of the score based on the number of correct guesses.
- Alerts users when they win or lose the game.
- Offers the option to retry after completing or losing the game.

## Installation

To run the game on your iOS device:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on your iOS device or simulator.

## Usage

- Enter a letter in the text field and tap "SUBMIT" to guess.
- Tap "CLEAR" to clear the input field.
- Tap on the letter buttons to input letters.
- Keep guessing until you reveal the entire word or run out of tries.
- Retry the game if you win or lose.
